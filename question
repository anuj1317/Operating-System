####
Write a C program to simulate multi-level queue scheduling algorithm considering the following scenario. All
the processes in the system are divided into two categories â€“ system processes and user processes. System
processes are to be given higher priority than user processes. The priority of each process ranges from 1 to 3.
Use fixed priority scheduling for all the processes.
